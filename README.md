## Overview

### REST API

Powered by Spring Boot, backend for the web interface and `paperweight`. Routes are under `/api`.

### paperweight

`paperweight` has tasks to interface with the REST API during the update process.

### Web Interface

SvelteKit frontend using tailwindcss for styling. Hosted as static files by the Spring Boot server.

#### Public Pages

- [`/`](https://patch-roulette.papermc.io): Multi-file concise diff viewer

#### Authenticated Pages

- `/roulette/login`: Login page
- `/roulette`: Management dashboard

### Web Extension

Web extension that streamlines opening diffs in the viewer.

## Development

Note that Bun can be substituted with the package manager of your choice.

### Setup

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and execute `bun install` in `/web` to install the required dependencies for the frontend.
- Install a JVM 21 or newer for the Gradle runtime (prefer a JDK to avoid extra downloads for a compiler).

### Testing

- The frontend can be tested with `bun run devLocalServer` or `bun run devProdServer` in `/web`. `devLocalServer` will use localhost as the API, `devProdServer` will use the production API at https://patch-roulette.papermc.io/api.
- The backend can be tested with `./gradlew bootRun` in the project root.

### Code Style

- The frontend uses ESLint and Prettier for code style. Run `bun run format` to reformat and `bun run lint` to check style.
- The backend simply has a `.editorconfig` file for code style.

### Deployment

- Published to the GitHub Container Registry on each commit through the `publish` actions workflow.
